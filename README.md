## Technologies
- Unity, C#

## Core Features
- **SquareGenerator.cs, ColorGenerator.cs** - The grid is filled with four different colors: light blue, light pink, dark blue and dark pink.
- **SquareVanisher.cs** - Clicking on a square/patch will make itself disappear and so do its neighbours having the same color. These neighbours are detected through a DFS traversal algorithm.
- **SquareVanisher.cs** - In the mean time, the neighbours with different colors will change their current color to one of the other three colors randomly.
- **ScoreRecorder.cs, GemSpawn.cs** - The more squares you remove, the more points you get. AND you will finally reveal the gems beneath it.
- **Timer.cs** - However, a timer is added to make the game more tense, yet more fun as a nature of games.
